Museum of Borderlands

A machine learning web app using Tensorflow.js, WebRTC and node-osc. Streams and classifies webcam feed and sends OSC messages to MaxMSP. Part of an interactive installation.

Broadcast.js streams webcam video to watch.js. This allows exhibition visitors to interact with watch.js page (home page) without disrupting the classification process that takes place in broadcast.js.

WebRTC partly based on https://github.com/TannerGabriel/WebRTC-Video-Broadcast
